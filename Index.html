<h2>Empress Cyrus</h2>
<p>
Greetings, I’m Empress Cyrus — the founder of Divine Code.  
Divine Code was created for those building their platforms, sharing their vision, 
and stepping into their digital presence with intention.  

Divine Code is here to help you manifest your dream website — one that doesn’t 
just function, but radiates. Each website carries its own energy, its own unique 
code, just like the person or brand it represents.  

You are unique, and so should your platform. With Divine Code, your online 
presence won’t blend in — it will align, attract and expand.
